  summary: Saga is the most beautiful way to connect with music.

Saga only downloads the best quality music, with album art and track information embedded in every track.
Your app is always up to date with Saga's in-built updating system. You never have to download another APK.
There are no restrictions to the number of songs you can stream or download. It's free and always will be.
